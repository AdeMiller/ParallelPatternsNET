# Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET

**Design Patterns for Decomposition and Coordination on Multicore Architectures**  
Colin Campbell, Ralph Johnson, Ade Miller and Stephen Toub. Foreword by Tony Hey  

<img align="left" src="docs/cover.png"/> A book that introduces .NET programmers to patterns for including parallelism in their applications. Examples of these patterns are parallel loops, parallel tasks and data aggregation with map-reduce. Each pattern has its own chapter. Each chapter includes a description of the problem, an example of where the pattern is applicable, and code that implements the solution. On this site you will find; a preliminary draft of the book, the accompanying code samples and answers to the end of chapter questions.

[**Download the samples for each chapter in C#, Visual Basic and F#**](http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/releases/view/50473)

*   [Blog posts about the F# samples](http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-samples.aspx)

The samples are written in C#, F#  and Visual Basic and use the new [parallel programming model ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460693(VS.100).aspx) that shipped with [Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions). The samples use the parallel features of the .NET Framework version 4, which includes the [Task Parallel Library (TPL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460717(VS.100).aspx) and [Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460688(VS.100).aspx).

**Demos and Talks**

<img align="left" src="docs/adatum.png"/> The demo that does along with the TechEd 2010 [ parallel patterns talk](http://www.ademiller.com/blogs/tech/2010/06/patterns-of-parallel-programming-teched-talk-online/) is also available. This is essentially the sample from Chapter 5 of “[Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET](http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/)” with additional work to show additional patterns used within the same sample to enhance performance of the individual steps within the overall workflow. It also has a much nicer UI and checkboxes that allow the user to select parallel and sequential versions of different parts of the application.

**What about C++?**  

Interested in parallel programming but prefer C++? We have also produced a companion book for C++ developers using the [Parallel Patterns Library (PPL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492418(VS.100).aspx) and [Asynchronous Agents Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492627.aspx). You can find out more about it on our other CodePlex site [Parallel Programming with Microsoft Visual C++](http://parallelpatternscpp.codeplex.com/).  

**System Requirements**  

You will need .NET 4 and at least [Visual Studio 2010 Professional](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/download) to run the samples. However, you will need [Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/download) to use some the parallel diagnostic tools such as the Concurrency Visualizer.
